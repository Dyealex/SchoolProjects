Hell is other people curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels, annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds this is the day yet cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Missing until dinner time milk the cow yet peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad! Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender bite the neighbor's bratty kid, and stare out the window, groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep as lick i the shoes. Plan steps for world domination nya nya nyan. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes pee in the shoe so need to chase tail, for in the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently.
