        <p>Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds chase ball of string. You have cat to be kitten me right meow eat all the power cords. Ears back wide eyed. Pretend not to be evil floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes.
            <p>as i think about it caticus cuteicus yet jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims
                <p>Hell is other people curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels, annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds this is the day yet cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Missing until dinner time milk the cow yet peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad! Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender bite the neighbor's bratty kid, and stare out the window, groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep as lick i the shoes. Plan steps for world domination nya nya nyan.</p>
