    <p>Our BIG salad is a truly big salad with a little price. A huge bed of baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, shredded cheese, diced ham, fried onions, egg crumbles....whatever else we can dig up. These salads are made up weeks in advance so <b>NO special requests!</b><br><h4>$10</h4></p>

<div id ="item3"><b>Cheeseburger Combo</b>
    <p>The cheeseburger combo comes with a cheeseburger (DUH!), fries and a drink. The burgers come with lettuce, tomatoes onions and pickles. If you don't want it on there, take it off yourself. We supply you with packets of mustard, mayo and ketchup. A "do it yourself" burger kit. Please DO NOT make us overextend ourselves trying to serve you. <h4>$9</h4></p>

   <div id ="item4"><b>Hamburger Combo</b>
    <p>Big surprise! This combo is the same as the cheeseburger combo but without cheese. Do not try to make a joke out of ordering a hamburger combo and requesting cheese on it. We have heard it all before. It wasn't funny then and it will not be funny now.<h4>$8</h4></p>
